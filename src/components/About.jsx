        <p>
          I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience in building 
          modern web applications. I specialize in React, Node.js, and cloud technologies, 
          with a strong focus on creating scalable and maintainable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in tech started with a Computer Science degree, and I've since worked 
          with startups and enterprise companies, helping them build robust applications 
          that serve thousands of users.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, 
          writing technical blogs, or exploring new technologies. I believe in continuous 
          learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
