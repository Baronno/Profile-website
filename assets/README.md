Place your avatar image here and name it exactly `personal-avatar.png` (or update `src/content.json` `header.avatar` to match).

Recommended size: 256x256 or 512x512 PNG or JPG. Example path used by the site: `/assets/personal-avatar.png`.

Note: Vite serves `public/` as the site root. Files placed in `public/assets/` will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/assets/<file>` during dev.
